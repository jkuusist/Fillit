# Fillit
Our solution for school 42's Fillit project. In this pair project, the goal is to create a program that takes a file of tetriminos as input and creates the smallest possible square out of them.

To create the executable, just type make. To run it, type ./fillit [target file], where [target file] is a path to the file you want to run it on.
Example files, both valid and invalid, can be found in the Test_Files directory. For invalid files, it will print "error". For valid ones, it will print the smallest possible square that can 
be created from those tetriminos.
